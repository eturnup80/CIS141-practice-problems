# 1. Prompt the user for a word. Then, prompt the user for how many times they'd like that word repeated. Use the skills you learned in this module to print the word the correct number of times.
word = input("What is your favorite sports team name?")
cheer = int(input("How many times would you like to cheer for your favorite team?"))
print(("Go " + word +"! ")*cheer)
#2. Prompt the user for their name and their age. Calculate their age next year. Use string concatenation to print "Hello, <name>! You are <age1> years old. Next year, you will be <age2> years old."
name = input("What is your name?")
age = int(input("What is your age?"))
next_year = (age + 1)
print("Hello,",name,"!", "You are",age,"years old. Next year, you will be",next_year,"years old.")
#3. Prompt the user for a sentence and a word to try to find in that sentence. Have the program print out whether the word was found in the sentence. (i.e. True or False)
sentence = input("Please provide your favorite sentence ever.")
word = input("Would you like to search your sentence for a certain word?... You would?! Great! What single word would you like to search for in your sentence?")
result = (word in sentence)
print("It is in fact",result,"that the exact word you wanted to search for is contained within the sentence that you provided.")
#4. Prompt the user for: a word, a first index, and a last index. Slice the word at the indexes provided by the user and print to the screen.
word = input("What is your favorite word?")
first = int(input("Please provide a 'first index' that I can practice my programming with."))
second = int(input("Great, thank you! Now please provide a 'second index' that I can practice my programming with."))
print(word[first:second])
#5. Print 3 words with a | character (called a pipe) in between them. Use the appropriate keyword argument in print() to do so.
phrase1 = "Go Seattle Seahawks!"
phrase2 = phrase1.split(" ")
print("|".join(phrase2))
