#1. Prompt the user for a positive integer n. Use a while loop to sum all the integers from 1 up to n. Print the final sum.
n = int(input("Please enter a positive number: "))

if n <= 0:
    print("Please enter a POSITIVE number... : ")
else:
    sum = 0
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        sum += i
        i += 1
    print(sum)
#2. Define a string variable (e.g., my_string = "Olympic College"). Use a for loop to print each character on its own line. Convert each character to uppercase before printing.
my_string = "Olympic College"
big = my_string.upper()
for i in range(0,len(my_string)):
    print(big[i])
#3. Use a for loop and the range() function to print all even numbers from 2 to 20.
for i in range(2,21,2):
    print(i)
#4. Use nested for loops to create a simple multiplication table for numbers 1 through 5. Format your output so that each row corresponds to multiplying by a specific number. Example output:
# 1   2   3   4   5
# 2   4   6   8   10
# 3   6   9   12  15
# 4   8   12  16  20
# 5   10  15  20  25
for i in range(1,6):
    for j in range(1,6):
        print(i*j, end="    ")
    print("")
#5. Write a program that continuously asks the user to input a number. If the user enters 0, immediately stop asking for more numbers. Otherwise, print the number they entered. Sample interaction:
# EXAMPLE OUTPUT
'''
Enter a number (0 to stop): 4
You entered 4
Enter a number (0 to stop): 7
You entered 7
Enter a number (0 to stop): 0
Exiting...
'''
# EXAMPLE OUTPUT
num = int(input("Enter a number (0 to stop): "))
while num != 0:
    print("You entered",num)
    num = int(input("Enter a number (0 to stop): "))
