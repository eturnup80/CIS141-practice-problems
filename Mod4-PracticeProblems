#1. Construct a truth table for the expression: (A AND B) OR (NOT B) where A and B each can be True or False. Your truth table should be commented out (as it's not valid Python code!)
# A B       (A AND B)       (NOT B)     (A AND B) OR (NOT B)
# T T       T               F           T
# T F       F               T           T
# F T       F               F           F
# F F       F               T           T

#2. The headlights of a car should only automatically turn on when the daylight outside is below a certain threshold. If a sensor threshold is below the number 8, print "Headlights On"; otherwise, print "Headlights Off".
daylight = 8
if daylight < 8:
    print("Headlights On")
else:
    print("Headlights Off")

#3. Prompt the user for their bank balance. Evaluate whether the balance is less than $100. Print True if the userâ€™s balance is below $100; print False, otherwise.
dollaz = int(input("What is the balance of your bank account?: "))
if dollaz < 100:
    print("True")
else:
    print("False")

#4. A theater wants to enforce age restrictions for movie tickets. Ask the user for their age, and tell them whether they can see G (appropriate for under 13), PG-13 (appropriate for 13 to 17), or R (appropriate for over 18) rated movies.
age = int(input("Hello, I'm the theater's Age Checker. I am here to tell you what movie ratings are appropriate for your age group. What is your age? "))
if age < 13:
    print("You can see G rated movies.")
elif age <= 17:
    print("You can see PG-13, and below, rated movies.")
elif age >= 18:
    print("You can see R, and below, rated movies.")

#5. A store charges $5 for shipping on any order under $50. If the order amount is $50 or more, shipping is free. Ask the user for the order total and print the total cost, including shipping.
subtotal = int(input("What is the total price for your order? "))
if subtotal >= 50:
    print("Wonderful. You get free shipping on your order! Your total cost today will be: $"+str(subtotal))
elif subtotal < 50:
    print("Alright, let me just add $5 for shipping. Your total today will be: $" + str(subtotal + 5))
